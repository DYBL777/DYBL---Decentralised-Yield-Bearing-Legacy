# DYBL — Decentralised Yield-Bearing Legacy

DYBL — The Payment Primitive Chainlink Needs

What if Chainlink had a flagship consumer app that proved crypto works for regular people?

Lettery: The flagship perpetual yield-bearing lottery primitive

A no-loss, immutable lottery where:
- **The Eternal Seed**: a self-sustaining compounding engine keeps growth alive indefinitely
- Lettery, a 42 char meme/name viral game
- 100% of ticket sales go directly into a transparent yield-bearing vault
- Chainlink VRF ensures provably fair draws
- A unique behavioral toggle encourages consistent saving
- Treasury revenue sunsets to zero forever
- Legacy mode enables on-chain inheritance

Designed to become a standard primitive for lotteries, insurance, pensions, subscriptions, and more.

## Why DYBL Succeeds Where Others Failed

| Feature | PoolTogether | DYBL |
|---------|--------------|------|
| Works at low yield? | No (needs 5%+) | **Yes (Eternal Seed)** |
| Treasury endgame | ~10% forever | **0% (after sunset)** |
| Prize sustainability | Declining | **Exponentially growing** |

**Status**: Research prototype seeking technical partnership (especially Chainlink, Aave, and Patrick Collins-inspired teams)

## Special Invitation to Collaborate
This primitive was designed from the ground up around Chainlink oracles and automation, with 100% of funds flowing forever into an Aave vault for transparent yield.

## Personal Note from the Inventor
I'm a creative, therapist (20+ years), and Chainlink follower, not a developer.  
I've spent years designing fair systems. My goal is for DYBL to live on as a true public good.

Personal circumstances mean I can't lead the full build/audit/launch myself. I would be deeply grateful if Chainlink Labs, Patrick Collins & Cyfrin-aligned teams, Aave Labs/Stani Kulechov, or similar partners considered taking the lead on scaling and deployment while I advise on the vision, behavioral design, and legacy mechanics.

Commercial/production terms under the BUSL are fully negotiable for aligned partners who share the public-good, no-rug vision.

If any of the above (or similar teams) are interested in leading the audit, refinement, and deployment — please reach out via DM. @dybl77

## Support the Inventor
I'm building DYBL full-time while caring for family — no team, no funding.  
If the vision resonates and you'd like to help it grow (audits, scaling, or just want to support), donations are deeply appreciated:

Thank you — every bit helps to turn this into the legacy it can be.
