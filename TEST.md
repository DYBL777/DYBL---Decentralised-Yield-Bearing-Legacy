  <h1>The Eternal Seed</h1>
  <h3>A Sustainable Compounding Mechanism<br>for Yield-Bearing Payments & Subscriptions</h3>

<br>

## Abstract

The Eternal Seed is a novel economic primitive that transforms recurring payments and subscriptions into **regenerative, yield-generating flows** — even in low/zero-yield environments.

It combines:
- **Fixed baseline retention** for perpetual compounding  
- **Rolling decreasing treasury injections** for strong early growth  
- Optional **behavioral forfeit flywheel** for consistency rewards

Example flagship application: **Lettery** — no-loss lottery with Pavlovian saver/gambler toggle.

## Introduction

Global subscription economy > **$650B**  
Remittances, utilities, recurring payments → **trillions** more

Most of this capital sits in **~0–1%** accounts — benefiting platforms, not users.

**The Eternal Seed** flips the script.

> All figures in this document (10% retention, 55% weekly payout, injection schedule, etc.)  
> are **draft examples only** for the V1 research prototype.

They **will be revised** through:

## The Eternal Seed Mechanism

Three core components:

1. **Fixed Baseline Retention**  
   ~10% of inflows retained forever → creates the perpetual compounding "seed"

2. **Rolling Decreasing Treasury Injections**  
   Early lifecycle: idle treasury funds injected weekly  
   → starts high → decreases gradually → eventually reaches 0  
   → gives strong early exponential growth

3. **Behavioral Forfeit Flywheel** (optional)  
   Missed payments → partial yield forfeit → rewards consistency  
   → 50/50 split (treasury / main pot)
